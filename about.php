            <p class="about__description">I'm a software engineer who loves creating efficient and reliable
                backend RESTful APIs using Spring Boot,
                as well as crafting beautiful and user-friendly front ends with React. </p>

            <p class="about__description">My programming language arsenal includes (but is not limited to) C++,
                Java, C, and Python,
                which I use to bring my ideas to life. </p>

            <p class="about__description"> When I'm not glued to my keyboard, you'll probably find me indulging
                in my love for photography, exploring new hiking trails, or trying out new coffee shops.</p>
